# AdaEngine Development

Use this skill for production work in the AdaEngine repository. Treat the checked-out source, `Package.swift`, the nearest tests, and the repository `AGENTS.md` as the source of truth; documentation and generated projects can lag behind them.

## Start Here

1. Read the repository `AGENTS.md` completely before editing. Check for a more specific `AGENTS.md` in the target subtree.
2. Run `git status --short --branch`. Preserve unrelated edits and untracked files. Do not clean, reset, or rewrite the user's worktree.
3. Identify the actual package boundary:
   - Engine/runtime work uses the root `Package.swift`.
   - AdaEditor is a separate package under `Editor/` and depends on the root package by local path.
   - XcodeGen configuration for the editor lives in `Editor/project.yml`; regenerate the project after changing inputs that it owns.
   - Web export and command/build plugins live under `Plugins/` and are enabled conditionally by the root manifest.
4. Inspect the nearest implementation and tests before choosing an API. Search with `rg` and `rg --files`; do not infer current APIs from old examples.
5. Choose the smallest module that owns the behavior. Avoid adding dependencies to the `AdaEngine` facade when a lower-level target is the correct home.

For an unfamiliar subsystem or a cross-module change, read [references/architecture.md](references/architecture.md). For ECS, system scheduling, resources, queries, or hot paths, also read [references/ecs-runtime.md](references/ecs-runtime.md). For AdaUI or AdaEditor, read [references/ui-editor.md](references/ui-editor.md). For platform, renderer, WebGPU, or WASM work, read [references/platform-render-web.md](references/platform-render-web.md). Before running validation, read [references/validation.md](references/validation.md).

## Non-Negotiable Engineering Rules

- Use Swift 6.2 language and concurrency semantics unless the checked-out manifest explicitly changes them. The package enables strict memory safety and upcoming `MemberImportVisibility`.
- Keep imports minimal and sorted. Follow `.swiftlint.yml`; in particular avoid force unwraps and broad access-control changes.
- Prefer value types in data-oriented paths. Use reference types for identity or shared ownership only. Avoid allocations, existential churn, and copy-on-write surprises in per-frame ECS/render/UI loops.
- Preserve actor boundaries. UI, application lifecycle, and platform glue normally belong on `@MainActor`; world finalization uses `WorldActor`. Prefer structured concurrency and explicit `Sendable` values.
- Do not use `nonisolated(unsafe)`, `@unchecked Sendable`, detached tasks, or raw-pointer escape hatches without a concrete synchronization or lifetime argument.
- Keep platform code behind existing compile-time conditions. A macOS fix must not silently break Windows, Linux, Android, WASI, iOS, tvOS, or visionOS compilation.
- Do not edit vendored C/C++ trees such as glslang, SPIRV-Cross, libpng, HarfBuzz, miniaudio, box2d, or box3d unless the requested change specifically targets that dependency.
- New package tests under `Tests/` use Swift Testing (`import Testing`, `@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`, `#require`), not new XCTest cases.
- Public APIs with non-obvious behavior need doc comments. Prefer additive, source-compatible changes unless the user explicitly requests a breaking redesign.
- Tests must exercise the production path. For editor filesystem, package, SourceKit/LSP, resource, or rendering behavior, use a real temporary project/resource/window when that behavior is material; a mock-only or source-text assertion is not sufficient evidence.

## Implementation Workflow

### Diagnose or review

Trace behavior from its public entry point to the owning subsystem. Confirm the failing state with a focused command or test when practical. Report the cause and evidence; do not implement a fix unless the request includes implementation.

### Change or build

1. Define the behavioral invariant and the owning target.
2. Add or update the nearest focused test when practical.
3. Implement the smallest production-path change; avoid opportunistic refactors.
4. Run the focused test first, then the owning test target, then broader validation proportional to risk.
5. Inspect `git diff --check`, `git diff --stat`, and the final task-owned diff. Confirm `Package.resolved` or generated project changes are intentional.
6. For runtime or UI work, build success alone is not completion when the executable path can be launched or exercised safely.

### Performance-sensitive changes

Establish which path is hot before optimizing. Preserve ECS query/access declarations so the scheduler can reason about read/write conflicts. Prefer chunk/batch operations over one bridge/proxy/allocation per entity. Validate semantics first, then benchmark or profile a realistic workload; do not make universal performance claims from a synthetic micro-test alone.

## Completion Standard

State exactly what changed, which commands passed, and what remains unverified. Distinguish failures caused by the requested diff from pre-existing worktree, dependency, platform, environment, or cache failures. Never describe a generated target, successful compilation, or static source check as proof that an editor app, UI interaction, renderer, or exported web bundle actually works.
