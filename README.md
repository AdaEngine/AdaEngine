## What is AdaEngine?

AdaEngine is a game engine fully written on Swift. The main idea is to encourage Swift developers to use this game engine to create fast and impressive games and user interfaces using Swift as their main language. We hope that AdaEngine can become as popular in the GameDev community as Rust and C# are.

## Design Goals

* **Capable:** Offer a complete 2D feature set.
* **ECS:** AdaEngine is based on the data-oriented paradigm using a self-written ECS. The AdaEngine has been inspired by Apple's RealityKit framework.
* **Simple:** AdaEngine is easy to use, and our main goal is to enable a quick start and deliver quick results.
