# Ada Coding

- Identify whether the project is AdaScript-only or SwiftPM-backed before selecting commands.
- Follow existing neighboring code, component registrations, plugins, and generated-source contracts.
- For AdaScript, use project diagnostics and the in-process AdaScript build. Do not invent Swift-only APIs.
- For Swift, use the project package model and the narrowest applicable build or test.
- Preserve unrelated edits and report exact validation scope. Build output is not proof of runtime behavior when the change affects rendering or interaction.
