/// Use this function for internal consistency checks that are active during testing

/// in Release builds, see `precondition(_:_:file:line:)`.
///
/// * In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode's Debug
///   configuration): If `condition` evaluates to `false`, stop program
///   execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.
///
/// * In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode's Release configuration),
///   `condition` is not evaluated, and there are no effects.
///
/// * In `-Ounchecked` builds, `condition` is not evaluated, but the optimizer
///   may assume that it *always* evaluates to `true`. Failure to satisfy that
///   assumption is a serious programming error.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - condition: The condition to test. `condition` is only evaluated in
///     playgrounds and `-Onone` builds.
///   - message: A string to print if `condition` is evaluated to `false`. The
///     default is an empty string.
///   - file: The file name to print with `message` if the assertion fails. The
///     default is the file where `assert(_:_:file:line:)` is called.
///   - line: The line number to print along with `message` if the assertion
///     fails. The default is the line number where `assert(_:_:file:line:)`
///     is called.
