## Overview

AdaEngine is a modern, open-source game engine written in Swift, designed for building 2D and 3D games with simplicity and performance in mind. Its architecture leverages the Entity Component System (ECS) paradigm, enabling developers to create games and interactive experiences using a modular and scalable approach.

AdaEngine provides a suite of built-in features, including:
- High-level rendering system supporting 2D and 3D graphics
- Physics, animation, input handling, audio, and UI systems
- Asset management pipeline and streamlined workflows
- Cross-platform support across Apple platforms and Linux
- Hot-reload capabilities for assets and scripts
- Modern Swift API with async/await, property wrappers, and result builders

With AdaEngine, both beginners and experienced Swift developers can build games rapidly, focusing on gameplay instead of low-level boilerplate. Extensive documentation and tutorials make it easy to get started, from setting up your first scene to advanced gameplay mechanics.

AdaEngine is actively developed, and contributions from the community are welcome.
